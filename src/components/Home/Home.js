          <p>Iâ€™m Samantha, the twentysomething travel planner, blogger, and designer behind the curated adventure. I currently live in Massachusetts with my husband and spoiled cat, Sansa.</p>

          <p>I started this journey in 2018, when a friend asked me to help plan her vacation to Europe. After a few more requests, I realized that this is something I was good at, and I really LOVED doing. At the beginning of 2019, I became a certified travel agent specializing in Disney destinations, European getaways, and tropical adventures.</p>

          <p>On any given day, you can probably find me with a dozen tabs open, writing a blog post about my latest travel idea, and enjoying an afternoon cup of tea. I love spending time exploring new places, trying new snacks in Disney, and indulging in the obligatory weekly run to Target.</p>
